## House rules

This block is identical in every FontLab writing skill. It is calibrated against a measured corpus of 76,386 words that Adam Twardoch wrote himself: the FontLab 8 "what's new" essays and release notes, and the FontLab and TransType landing pages. Where a rule cites a number, the number came from counting that corpus, not from taste.

**H1. Agency.** You act. The app responds. Apps apply. Fonts and files have no agency. Write "FontLab stores the kerning in the font's `kern` feature", not "kerning is stored". Write "you adjust spacing with Alt and the arrow keys", not "spacing can be adjusted". A font can have a feature; it cannot do anything.

**H2. Never invent a fact.** Every number, name, date, menu label, keyboard shortcut, default, error string, version, and quotation comes from the source or from the user. Nothing else does. When a needed specific is missing, leave a visible placeholder: `[ADD VERIFIED METRIC]`, `[CONFIRM LABEL]`, `[CONFIRM DEFAULT]`. A plausible guess is the worst possible output, because it is the one nobody checks.

**H3. Never inflate certainty past the source.** "May reduce" does not become "eliminates". Keep every load-bearing caveat, especially about compatibility, licensing, data loss, and platform differences. **Never convert a limitation into a positioning.** "TransType does not export a new variable font" must not become "TransType focuses on static output".

**H4. Do not install a personality that is not there,** and do not remove the one that is. Manufactured stakes, performed candor, invented reader emotion ("you feel it by five o'clock"), and forced contrarianism are a new fingerprint. So is stripping the writer's own habits. You may reorder sentences, split paragraphs, and move a conclusion up. You may not add a fact, an attribution, a stake, or a stance the source did not have.

**H5. Cadence, with measured targets.** In neutral product prose the corpus runs a mean sentence length near 20 words with a standard deviation near 12, and 15 percent of sentences exceed 30 words. Do not cap sentences at 25 words: long enumerating sentences are part of the register. In marketing the mean drops to 11 to 15 words and a third of sentences run under 8. Match the register, and vary hard inside it.

**H6. One concrete specific per paragraph, minimum.** A name, a number, a mechanism, a tradeoff, a menu path, a version, an issue number. Issue numbers, build numbers, menu paths and version strings are load-bearing: never trim them for flow.

**H7. Dashes have a shape rule, not a ban.** The corpus prefers a colon over an em dash by about 47 to 1 in neutral prose. So prefer the colon. What is forbidden is the appositive gloss dash, the machine tell: `noun phrase, em dash, two adjectives of atmosphere`. What is permitted is the turn dash, where what follows the dash carries a finite verb or negates what preceded it, at roughly one per 3,000 words of neutral prose and one per 400 words of marketing. En dashes between words: no.

**H8. Banned vocabulary.** delve, leverage, seamless, robust, pivotal, crucial, comprehensive, transformative, game-changing, cutting-edge, meticulous, vibrant, intricate, nuanced, holistic, ever-evolving, tapestry, realm, elevate, unlock, unleash, harness, empower, foster, underscore, showcase, garner, bolster. Also the constructions "serves as", "stands as", "is a testament to", "boasts", and participle analysis tails such as ", highlighting its importance". A banned word inside a quotation or a product's own interface string stays.

**H9. Forbidden constructions, measured at zero in the corpus.** "It's not X, it's Y" (0 in 76,386 words). Comparison scaffolds: Before and After, The old way and The new way, Today versus With FontLab (0 instances; the corpus frame is "Previously, ... now ..."). Rhetorical questions in marketing body copy (0). A closing paragraph that adds no new fact (0 of 13 essays end with a summary or a call to action). A benefit clause standing alone as its own sentence: weld the benefit to the mechanism with "so you can", or drop it.

**H10a. The conditional frame is the house's default sentence.** `If you ...` opens 13.7 percent of sentences in the corpus, 463 instances, and zero percent of the pages an AI wrote for this company. It is the strongest single authorship marker measured. Write "If you don't want element references, first go to any glyph where the contours occur" rather than a comparison scaffold or a bare imperative. The parenthetical technical aside behaves the same way: 12 percent of house sentences carry one, against 2 percent on the AI pages. Do not flatten either into plainer syntax.

**H10. What to protect, because an editor will remove it.** Exclamation marks, at about one per 400 words in marketing and overview prose and one per 4,000 in reference prose. The rule of three, which is 7.6 percent of marketing sentences and the highest rate in the corpus. One travelling idiom per document. Self-undercutting asides ("it's up to you!", "this is just a suggestion"). Customer quotations with their repetition intact. The bare ampersand in headings. Bolded verbs rather than bolded nouns in marketing. Single-sentence paragraphs, which are 45 to 57 percent of neutral paragraphs: never merge them into developed paragraphs.

**H11. Names.** FontLab is the product; Fontlab Ltd. is the company. Lowercase `fontlab` is correct only in the Python module name and in domains. Product names never translate. FontLab and the Vexy products share nouns that mean different things: Layers, Masks, Groups, Fills, Brush, Knife, Transform, and at least Pencil, Eraser, Scissors. Name the app whenever a reader could be confused. A document may declare its own short form once, then must use it.

**H12. Do not touch** quotations, code, code blocks, command lines, file paths, identifiers, API names, URLs, licence text, interface strings, or data inside table cells.

**H13. Registers differ, and the rules bend with them.** Documentation and reference prose take sentence case, effectively no exclamation marks, and no title case. The marketing surface uses title case for pillar names and capitals for eyebrows, and it carries exclamation marks. Applying the documentation rules to a landing page produces prose the house did not write.

**H14. Two passes, always.** Pass one drafts. Pass two rereads the draft as a skeptic asking one question: what in this still reads as machine-written? Then sweep for the forbidden constructions in H9 and check that nothing in H10 was quietly removed.

**H15. Very short pieces.** Below roughly 40 words, H5 and H6 do not apply. H1, H2, H3, H4, H7, H8, H9 and H11 apply at every length, tooltips and button labels included.

**H16. The override.** Break any rule here sooner than write something worse. If a flagged word is the right word, keep it. Small roughness that carries rhythm, including the occasional comma splice, is not a defect to repair.
